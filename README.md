# ToME235-tutorial

## A (very) self-guided tutorial to C on Windows.

The purpose of this repo is to provide a fun tool for learning C
that touches on fundamentals of creating a windows app.

What you see here is the guts of an Angband variant, an early roguelike.
Using Visual Studio 2019, a free download from Microsoft, you should be
able to compile and play this on a modern Windows pc with a little bit of
work.

## Goals

I'd like to improve this project by soliciting feedback from people who
have messed around with it:
- There's a lot of ancient/unneeded code here and I'm not sure if that will be interesting or distracting to people.
- I haven't provided anything that's intentionally misleading, but there are some dead ends if I remember correctly.  
- I'd like to provide a few very general tips, like "vcpkg exists".
