# ToME235-tutorial

## A (very) self-guided tutorial to C on Windows.

The purpose of this repo is to provide a fun tool for learning C
that touches on fundamentals of creating a windows app.

I wanted to learn more about compilation in general, and I love roguelikes.
I spent some time trying to build an old roguelike on Win10, and it was a
really enjoyable experience.  I feel like it touched on a lot of fundamentals
and a little bit of CS history.

But I'm one person with one point of view, and I'd love to hear from you
if you try to build this yourself.  This is the guts of an Angband variant, 
an early roguelike.  Using Visual Studio 2019, a free download from Microsoft, 
you should be able to compile and play this on a modern Windows pc with a little 
bit of work.
